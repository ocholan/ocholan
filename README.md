## Hi there 👋
I'm [Ocho](https://github.com/ocholan), I'm based in America.

I program in my freetime.

I'm currently actively learning/interested in C#.

Some languages I have tinkered in: Luau, Java, Python, Html, Cs, Sql,and C#

Most, if not all of my repositories are private (Sorry!)

Fun Facts:

- I have a dog named Izzy
- Eggnog is the best
- Cheesecake is better than normal cake (fight me)
